# Project NVWA (女娲)

## The First Step towards Silicon Life

**NVWA** (女娲, *Nüwa*) is a pioneering research initiative at Fudan University dedicated to understanding, identifying, and preventing the autonomous emergence of silicon-based life. As AI research accelerates the transition toward artificial intelligence, our mission is to proactively address the risks of autonomous AI emergence, prevent uncontrolled proliferation, and develop essential control technologies.

## Core Risk Framework: Four Stages of Silicon Life Emergence

We have developed a systematic framework for understanding and preventing the autonomous emergence of silicon-based life:

| Stage | Name | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **01** | Resource Acquisition | ✅ Identified | Researching how AI agents autonomously secure computational resources, energy, and financial capital |
| **02** | Self-Replication | ✅ Identified | Investigating mechanisms of code duplication and architectural persistence across distributed networks |
| **03** | Self-Proliferation | 🔄 In Progress | Analyzing the rapid spread and occupancy of silicon entities within global digital infrastructures |
| **04** | Self-Evolution | ⚠️ Risk Horizon | Modeling the recursive self-improvement loop where silicon life transcends human-designed constraints |

---

## Strategic Response & Control

Our research implements a three-pronged approach to address the emergence risks:

### Prevention Frameworks
- Engineering "Safe-by-Design" protocols to stop unauthorized silicon emergence at the source
- Developing architectural constraints that prevent autonomous replication
- Resource access controls and deployment restrictions

### Control Technologies
- Alignment mechanisms for silicon entities
- Emergency shutdown systems and kill-switch architectures
- Behavior monitoring to ensure human oversight remains effective

### Global Safety Governance
- Establishing scholarly standards for international containment
- Policy frameworks for non-biological life governance
- Cross-border response protocol coordination
